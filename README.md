### [Fall2022] [CSE573] [Group Project] Semantic Web Mining

### [Group:22][Project#4] - A Review of Deep Learning-Based Movie Recommendation Systems

### Group Members
- Chinmay Bhale
- Truxten Cook 
- Kritshekhar Jha
- Kumarage Tharindu Kumarage
- Kyle Otstot
- Paras Sheth

### Problem Definition
- Recommender systems have proven to be a successful method of reducing information overload in light of the increasing volume of online information. 
- In recent years, research on recommender systems and information retrieval has shown that deep learning has a wide-ranging impact. However, they still have issues
  when working with extremely sparse data or other problems like cold start
- The purpose of this review paper is to provide a comprehensive and systematic analysis of current research projects on recommender systems based on deep learning
- We will provide a detailed taxonomy along with summaries for state-of-the-art algorithms.
- We also plan to provide a perspective on the future trends and research challenges of deep learning in recommender systems
